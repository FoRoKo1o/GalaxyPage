Welcome to the FoRoKo project! This project consists of a webpage with various components, including a starry background, comets animation, and interactive items. Below, you'll find an overview of the project structure and a brief description of each component.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that contains the structure of the webpage.
- `css/style.css`: The CSS file that styles the webpage.
- `js/comets.js`: JavaScript code for the comets animation.
- `js/menu.js`: JavaScript code for handling interactive items.
- `js/nebula.js`: JavaScript code for the nebula background effect.
- `js/stars.js`: JavaScript code for generating and animating stars.

## Components

### Starry Background

The starry background is created using HTML and CSS. It features animated stars of various colors on a gradient background that simulates a night sky.

### Comets Animation

The comets animation is implemented using JavaScript (`comets.js`). Comets are generated on the edge of the screen and move diagonally with a tail that fades out. This creates the effect of comets flying across the webpage.

### Interactive Items

The webpage includes interactive items (e.g., "Notifier," "FoRoKo," "DiscordBot") that can be expanded to reveal additional content when clicked. The interactivity is managed by JavaScript (`menu.js`). Clicking on an item expands it, revealing more information, and clicking again collapses it.

## Usage

To view the FoRoKo project, open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser. You can interact with the items on the page by clicking on them to expand and collapse their content.
